# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will be an adaptation of the Dot Game. The Dot Game is a mathematical exercise that introduces a sum of addition in a more abstract way without counting concrete objects. It is a visual aid that helps develop an understanding of the decimal system. The user will work through equations of large sums using the tools in the app to visualize the symbolic representation of large numbers.
Following the Montessori principles of beauty, order, and simplicity, the app will be visually pleasing and will continue the Montessori mathematical traditions, i.e. the color coding associated with 1000s, 100s, 10s, and 1s units. Ultimately, the app will serve the user as a "path to mathematical abstraction."
The idea for this app is inspired by my love of the Montessori teaching method. Some underlying goals of this app are to foster intrinsic motivation, self-correction, and to build self-confidence in the user. I intend for the application to be downloaded to induvidual desktops. The target age-group is students aged 5-6.

### Features
∙ User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Users will be able to keep track of their solved equations. 
∙ The Dot Game: The Dot Game is the main feature of the app. The user solves an equation involving the addition of two addends by systematically filling out a grid with a column representing each         unit in the decimal system (beginning with ones and moving on to tens, hundreds, and thousands). 
∙ Demonstrations: Users will be able to view the step-by-step solutions to sample equations in the Dot Game. 
∙ Printable books: Users will be able to print a collection of their solved equations that they can cut out and assemble into a book. This is a common activity in a Montessori classroom.
